		<h2>The Final of the USSR Cup of Football 1969</h2>
		<p>On August 17, 1969, Karpaty became the first (and the only) club in the USSR football history which won the USSR Cup while playing in the Soviet First League. The road to the cup was no less exciting as the final itself. 
		On the way there the Lions were challenged by the Soviet heavy-weights such as Ararat Yerevan and Chornomorets Odesa. The quarterfinal round matched them with Trud Foronezh that in the prior round eliminated Spartak Moscow. 
		After the minimal score victory Karpaty were faced with the Mykolaiv's Shipbuilders. The game was perceived by the Lvivians as the chance to avenge for the last year loss to the Mykolaivans, which cost them a ticket to the Soviet Premiers. 2–0 score was enough to secure the trip to Moscow.</p>
		<p>In the final, Karpaty played against the Army team from Rostov-on-Don at the Lenin's Stadium. The Rostov army-men were one of the best Soviet clubs in the mid-1960s and for that game they were considered as the favorites being the representatives of the Soviet Top League. 
		Before the start of the game the Karpaty's captain Ihor Kulchytsky traditionally shacked hands with every referee... except the side-liner Eugen Harms. The reason was that the Estonian referee in their last year game against Uralmash Sverdlovsk counted a goal from an obvious offside that eventually contributed to the Karpaty's denial of a promotion. 
		Karpaty were trailing 0–1 already after the first 20 minutes and to the end of the half were not able to equalize, but numerous Karpaty's fans drove their team forward.</p>
